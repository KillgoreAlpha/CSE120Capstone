    "content": "Based on your IL-6 levels (average of 4.47 pg/ml), you show signs of mild inflammation that is slightly elevated compared to healthy young individuals (who typically have 1-2 pg/ml) but similar to levels seen in healthy elderly individuals (2-4 pg/ml). This level is lower than what's seen in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (10 pg/ml or higher) or severe inflammation like sepsis. \nYour cortisol levels (average of 16.36 nmol/L) appear to be within normal ranges, though it's important to note that cortisol levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day. The relationship between cortisol and inflammation is complex, and while cortisol typically helps regulate inflammation, a \"normal\" cortisol level doesn't necessarily indicate optimal inflammatory control.",
