    "content": "Chronic inflammation is associated with obesity and may play a role in the development of several diseases. There are several modifiable factors that can affect inflammation levels, including dietary fiber intake, saturated fat intake, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and certain supplements/medications like glucosamine, fish oil, vitamin E, statins and aspirin. \nPhysical activity has an anti-inflammatory effect on the body. Regular exercise reduces visceral fat mass and creates an anti-inflammatory environment. Conversely, physical inactivity can lead to accumulation of visceral fat and activation of inflammatory processes. \nThe level of inflammation can vary significantly between individuals and conditions. In healthy young individuals, inflammatory markers (measured by IL-6) are typically low (1-2 pg/ml), while they can be much higher in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or sepsis. Factors such as psychological stress can also increase inflammatory markers.",
