Abstract
        
      



          Aims:
        
      
      This study aimed to evaluate the association between the systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII) and the risk of overactive bladder (OAB) in the adult United States population.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2010 were analyzed. A non-pregnant cohort aged ≥20 years with available SII and OAB data was included. Weighted univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between SII and OAB risk. Additionally, subgroup, interaction, and restricted cubic spline analyses were conducted.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 4,545 participants were included, of whom 16.13% had OAB, with a mean SII of 5.75 ± 0.07. OAB risk increased with higher SII tertiles. In the fully adjusted model (Model 2), individuals in the highest SII tertile exhibited a 41% higher risk of OAB compared to those in the lowest tertile (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.13-1.76, P = 0.004). Two-piece-wise regression analysis identified an SII breakpoint at 3.40, where a significant positive association was found for SII ≥ 3.40 (OR = 1.06, P < 0.0001), whereas no significant association was detected for SII < 3.40 (P = 0.06). Subgroup and interaction analyses revealed a consistent relationship between SII and OAB across different population strata, except for diabetes mellitus.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      SII, an easily accessible biomarker, was independently associated with an increased risk of OAB, highlighting its potential utility in diagnostic prediction.

Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      The predictive value of serum uric acid (SUA) for clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) remained unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of SUA in predicting all-cause mortality among critically ill patients diagnosed with SA-AKI.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This retrospective study examined 483 patients with SA-AKI at the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University from January 2015 to July 2023. The primary outcome evaluated in this study was in hospital all-cause mortality. To assess the prognostic value of SUA, we employed receiver operating characteristic curves, restricted cubic splines, Cox regression models, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality reached 43.3% and 42.2%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the risk of 30-day mortality (log-rank test, P < 0.001) and 60-day mortality (log-rank test, P = 0.001) was significantly higher in patients with hyperuricemia (HUA). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that elevated SUA levels were significantly related to all-cause mortality. After accounting for potential confounding factors, patients with HUA maintained a significant correlation with both hospital mortality [HR (95%CI): 1.462 (1.094-1.952); P = 0.010] and ICU mortality [HR (95%CI): 1.474 (1.096-1.983); P = 0.010]. Further examination using restricted cubic splines revealed a progressively increasing risk of all-cause mortality with rising SUA levels.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Higher levels of SUA were associated with an increased risk of both hospital mortality and ICU mortality in critically ill patients with SA-AKI. These findings suggested that SUA may serve as an independent prognostic marker for these patients.

          Background:
        
      
      Early neonatal mortality occurs within 7 days of life. Clinical variables, inflammatory markers and CRIB (Clinical Risk Index for Babies) could be useful to identify mortality risk.
    


          Objective:
        
      
      To assess the predictive value of inflammatory and clinical markers for early mortality in preterm newborns (PTNB) < 1500 g.
    


          Material and methods:
        
      
      Analytical, retroprospective, observational and cross-sectional study. PTNBs with birth weight < 1500 g were included. Clinical characteristics, CRIB, inflammatory markers and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated at 12 hours of life.

CRP, base deficit and birth weight were associated with mortality in the multivariate analysis (intercept = 6.62; SE = 1.85; R2 = 0.60; p = 0.0003). CRP ≥ 2.30 µg/dL showed a sensitivity of 26.32% and a specificity of 97.50% for mortality, AUC = 0.69, p = 0.005.
    


          Conclusions:
        
      
      Predictors of early mortality were weight ≤ 1000 g, gestational age ≤ 28 weeks and CRP ≥ 2.30 μg/dL.

Abstract
        
      



          Purpose:
        
      
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and asthma are connected through similar epidemiology, clinical symptoms, pathophysiological features, and risk factors. However, the shared genetic basis of these conditions remains poorly understood. This study sought to identify risk genes that contribute to both OSA and asthma and to explore their associated biological pathways.
    


          Methods:
        
      
      This study was conducted using an in silico approach based on publicly available Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data. Gene sets associated with OSA (2,159 genes) and asthma (786 genes) were manually curated from GWAS results. These lists were subsequently compared to identify intersecting genes, and their statistical significance was assessed using Fisher's Exact Test. Pathway enrichment analysis was conducted utilizing the Benjamini-Hochberg test with a significance threshold set at an adjusted p-value < 0.05.
    


          Results:
        
      
      A total of 187 genes overlapped between OSA and asthma, indicating a significantly higher occurrence than expected by chance. The pathway overrepresentation analysis of these intersecting genes identified processes associated with immune system functions, encompassing human leucocyte antigen (HLA), antigen presentation, cell differentiation, cell signaling, and positive regulation of inflammatory mediators.
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      This study unveils shared genetic mechanisms associated with OSA and asthma risks, highlighting intricate interactions within pathways governing immune response and inflammation. These findings provide a preliminary step toward understanding the genetic basis of this association; however, their clinical significance remains to be established. Further functional studies and validation in independent cohorts are needed to determine their potential relevance for biomarker development and immune-targeted therapeutic strategies.

---------------------------------------- ABSTRACT ----------------------------------------
The COVID-19 pandemic has left a lasting impact on individuals, with many
experiencing persistent symptoms, including inflammation, in the post-acute
phase of the disease. Detecting and monitoring these inflammatory biomarkers is
critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. This study
employs machine learning techniques to automate the identification of
persistent inflammatory biomarkers in 290 post-COVID-19 patients, based on
medical data collected from hospitals in Iraq. The data encompassed a wide
array of clinical parameters, such as C-reactive protein and interleukin-6
levels, patient demographics, comorbidities, and treatment histories. Rigorous
data preprocessing and feature selection processes were implemented to optimize
the dataset for machine learning analysis. Various machine learning algorithms,
including logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and
gradient boosting, were deployed to construct predictive models. These models
exhibited promising results, showcasing high accuracy and precision in the
identification of patients with persistent inflammation. The findings of this
study underscore the potential of machine learning in automating the detection
of persistent inflammatory biomarkers in post-COVID-19 patients. These models
can serve as valuable tools for healthcare providers, facilitating early
diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies for individuals at risk of
persistent inflammation, ultimately contributing to improved post-acute
COVID-19 care and patient well-being. Keywords: COVID-19, post-COVID-19,
inflammation, biomarkers, machine learning, early detection.

---------------------------------------- ABSTRACT ----------------------------------------
Treatment protocols, disease understanding, and viral characteristics changed
over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic; as a result, the risks associated
with patient comorbidities and biomarkers also changed. We add to the
conversation regarding inflammation, hemostasis and vascular function in
COVID-19 by performing a time-varying observational analysis of over 4000
patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in a New York City hospital system from
March 2020 to August 2021. To perform this analysis, we apply tree-based
generalized additive models with temporal interactions which recover
discontinuous risk changes caused by discrete protocols changes. We find that
the biomarkers of thrombosis increasingly predicted mortality from March 2020
to August 2021, while the association between biomarkers of inflammation and
thrombosis weakened. Beyond COVID-19, this presents a straightforward
methodology to estimate unknown and discontinuous time-varying effects.

---------------------------------------- ABSTRACT ----------------------------------------
Background. Diet and inflammation are critical factors influencing cancer
risk. However, the combined impact of nutritional status and inflammatory
biomarkers on cancer status and type, using machine learning (ML), remains
underexplored.
  Objectives. This study investigates the association between nutritional
factors, inflammatory biomarkers, and cancer status, and whether these
relationships differ across cancer types using National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) data.
  Methods. We analyzed 24 macro- and micronutrients, C-reactive protein (CRP),
and the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) in 26,409 NHANES
participants (2,120 with cancer). Multivariable logistic regression assessed
associations with cancer prevalence. We also examined whether these features
differed across the five most common cancer types. To evaluate predictive
value, we applied three ML models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and
XGBoost - on the full feature set.
  Results. The cohort's mean age was 49.1 years; 34.7% were obese.
Comorbidities such as anemia and liver conditions, along with nutritional
factors like protein and several vitamins, were key predictors of cancer
status. Among the models, Random Forest performed best, achieving an accuracy
of 0.72.
  Conclusions. Higher-quality nutritional intake and lower levels of
inflammation may offer protective effects against cancer. These findings
highlight the potential of combining nutritional and inflammatory markers with
ML to inform cancer prevention strategies.

Paper Title: Multimodal AI-driven Biomarker for Early Detection of Cancer Cachexia

Has Numerical Data: True
Date Retrieved: 2025-05-07
---------------------------------------- ABSTRACT ----------------------------------------
Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive
muscle wasting, metabolic dysfunction, and systemic inflammation, leading to
reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Despite extensive research, no
single definitive biomarker exists, as cachexia-related indicators such as
serum biomarkers, skeletal muscle measurements, and metabolic abnormalities
often overlap with other conditions. Existing composite indices, including the
Cancer Cachexia Index (CXI), Modified CXI (mCXI), and Cachexia Score (CASCO),
integrate multiple biomarkers but lack standardized thresholds, limiting their
clinical utility. This study proposes a multimodal AI-based biomarker for early
cancer cachexia detection, leveraging open-source large language models (LLMs)
and foundation models trained on medical data. The approach integrates
heterogeneous patient data, including demographics, disease status, lab
reports, radiological imaging (CT scans), and clinical notes, using a machine
learning framework that can handle missing data. Unlike previous AI-based
models trained on curated datasets, this method utilizes routinely collected
clinical data, enhancing real-world applicability. Additionally, the model
incorporates confidence estimation, allowing the identification of cases
requiring expert review for precise clinical interpretation. Preliminary
findings demonstrate that integrating multiple data modalities improves
cachexia prediction accuracy at the time of cancer diagnosis. The AI-based
biomarker dynamically adapts to patient-specific factors such as age, race,
ethnicity, weight, cancer type, and stage, avoiding the limitations of
fixed-threshold biomarkers. This multimodal AI biomarker provides a scalable
and clinically viable solution for early cancer cachexia detection,
facilitating personalized interventions and potentially improving treatment
outcomes and patient survival.

Abstract
        
      


      
      Neuroretinitis is an inflammatory type of optic nerve damage evidenced by the appearance of papillary edema. It also involves inflammation of the retinal layers, as evidenced by the thickening of these layers and the presence of intra- and subretinal fluid. Chorioretinitis is a condition in which inflammation of the posterior component of the uvea, the choroid, leads to further damage to the retina, causing it to become inflamed. The most common causes of neuroretinitis and chorioretinitis in the pediatric population are represented by infectious etiologies. Most cases of neuroretinitis in children are caused by cat scratch disease, which is typically attributed to the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. We present the case of a 10-year-old child who presented to our service complaining of a sudden decrease in vision and the appearance of a central scotoma two days before he was referred to our service. Our first diagnosis was of optic neuritis, based on the presence of objective papillary edema on fundus examination. Subsequently, the appearance of chorioretinal foci completely changed the diagnosis and treatment in this case.

          Objective:
        
      
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of minimally invasive surgery in elderly patients with cholecystolithiasis and choledocholithiasis and its effects on liver function and stress response.
    


          Study design:
        
      
      Comparative observational study. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Anyang City People's Hospital, Xinxiang Medical College, Anyang, China, from August 2021 to 2023.
    


          Methodology:
        
      
      Eighty-six elderly patients with cholecystolithiasis and choledocholithiasis were divided into two distinct groups. The control group (n = 43) underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in conjunction with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). The observation group (n = 43) received LC along with laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE). Comparative analysis of perioperative outcomes, complication rates, the frequency of residual stones, and liver function markers, including total bilirubin (TBil), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was made. Furthermore, inflammatory markers such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as stress markers including cortisol and epinephrine were also evaluated. Also, the quality of life both before and after surgery was assessed.
    


          Results:
        
      
      The observation group had better perioperative outcomes with a lower complication rate (4.65% vs. 20.93% in controls, p <0.05). Both groups showed significant post-surgical improvements in liver function markers (TBil, AST, ALT, p <0.05), with no significant inter-group differences. Postoperative inflammatory (TNF-α, CRP, IL-6) and stress markers (cortisol, epinephrine) increased significantly (p <0.05), with trends favouring lower levels in the observation group. Quality of life scores significantly improved in both groups one month post-surgery (p <0.05).
    


          Conclusion:
        
      
      LC combined with LCBDE is as effective as ERCP combined with LC for removing stones and improving liver function and quality of life in elderly patients with cholecystolithiasis and choledocholithiasis. However, the LC combined with the laparoscopic common bile duct exploration approach has fewer complications, reduces inflammation and stress responses, and supports better overall recovery, making it the preferred option for this patient population.

---------------------------------------- ABSTRACT ----------------------------------------
Cardiovascular activities are directly related to the response of a body in a
stressed condition. Stress, based on its intensity, can be divided into two
types i.e. Acute stress (short-term stress) and Chronic stress (long-term
stress). Repeated acute stress and continuous chronic stress may play a vital
role in inflammation in the circulatory system and thus leads to a heart attack
or to a stroke. In this study, we have reviewed commonly used machine learning
classification techniques applied to different stress-indicating parameters
used in stress monitoring devices. These parameters include Photoplethysmograph
(PPG), Electrocardiographs (ECG), Electromyograph (EMG), Galvanic Skin Response
(GSR), Heart Rate Variation (HRV), skin temperature, respiratory rate,
Electroencephalograph (EEG) and salivary cortisol, used in stress monitoring
devices. This study also provides a discussion on choosing a classifier, which
depends upon a number of factors other than accuracy, like the number of
subjects involved in an experiment, type of signals processing and
computational limitations.

---------------------------------------- ABSTRACT ----------------------------------------
Stress-induced glucocorticoid elevation is a highly conserved response among
vertebrates. This facilitates stress adaptation and the mode of action involves
activation of the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor leading to the
modulation of target gene expression. However, this genomic effect is slow
acting and, therefore, a role for glucocorticoid in the rapid response to
stress is unclear. Here we show that stress levels of cortisol, the primary
glucocorticoid in teleosts, rapidly fluidizes rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
mykiss) liver plasma membranes in vitro. This involved incorporation of the
steroid into the lipid domains, as cortisol coupled to a membrane impermeable
peptide moiety, did not affect membrane order. Studies confirmed that cortisol,
but not sex steroids, increases liver plasma membrane fluidity. Atomic force
microscopy revealed cortisol mediated changes to membrane surface topography
and viscoelasticity confirming changes to membrane order. Treating trout
hepatocytes with stress levels of cortisol led to the modulation of cell
signaling pathways, including the phosphorylation status of putative PKA, PKC
and AKT substrate proteins within 10 minutes. The phosphorylation by protein
kinases in the presence of cortisol was consistent with that seen with benzyl
alcohol, a known membrane fluidizer. Our results suggest that biophysical
changes to plasma membrane properties, triggered by stressor induced
glucocorticoid elevation, act as a nonspecific stress response and may rapidly
modulate acute stress-signaling pathways.

---------------------------------------- ABSTRACT ----------------------------------------
This article seeks to address the prevailing issue of how to measure specific
process components of psychobiological stress responses. Particularly the
change of cortisol secretion due to stress exposure has been discussed as an
endophenotype of many psychosomatic health outcomes. To assess its process
components, a large variety of non-compartmental parameters (i.e., composite
measures of substance concentrations at different points in time) like the area
under the concentration-time curve (AUC) are utilized. However, a systematic
evaluation and validation of these parameters based on a physiologically
plausible model of cortisol secretion has not been performed so far. Thus, a
population pharmacokinetic (mixed-effects SDE) model was developed and fitted
to densely sampled salivary cortisol data of 10 males from Montreal, Canada,
and sparsely sampled data of 200 mixed-sex participants from Dresden, Germany,
who completed the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Besides the two major
process components representing (1) stress-related cortisol secretion
(reactivity) and (2) cortisol elimination (recovery), the model incorporates
two additional, often disregarded components: (3) the secretory delay after
stress onset, and (4) deviations from the projected steady-state concentration.
The fitted model (R2 = 99%) was thereafter used to investigate the correlation
structure of the four individually varying, and readily interpretable model
parameters and eleven popular non-compartmental parameters. Based on these
analyses, we recommend to use the minimum-maximum cortisol difference and the
minimum concentration as proxy measures of reactivity and recovery,
respectively. Finally, statistical power analyses of the reactivity-related sex
effect illustrate the consequences of using impure non-compartmental measures
of the different process components that underlie the cortisol stress response.
