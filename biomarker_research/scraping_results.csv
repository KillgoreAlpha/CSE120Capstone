Serum uric acid level as a prognostic biomarker in critically ill patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury: A retrospective single-center study.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40333671/,"Abstract
        
      



          Background:
        
      
      The predictive value of serum uric acid (SUA) for clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) remained unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of SUA in predicting all-cause mortality among critically ill patients diagnosed with SA-AKI.

Genetic overlap and immunological pathways in asthma-obstructive sleep apnea coexistence.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40332677/,"Abstract
        
      



          Purpose:
        
      
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and asthma are connected through similar epidemiology, clinical symptoms, pathophysiological features, and risk factors. However, the shared genetic basis of these conditions remains poorly understood. This study sought to identify risk genes that contribute to both OSA and asthma and to explore their associated biological pathways.

      Neuroretinitis is an inflammatory type of optic nerve damage evidenced by the appearance of papillary edema. It also involves inflammation of the retinal layers, as evidenced by the thickening of these layers and the presence of intra- and subretinal fluid. Chorioretinitis is a condition in which inflammation of the posterior component of the uvea, the choroid, leads to further damage to the retina, causing it to become inflamed.
