    "content": "According to technical requirements for reliable heart rate variability (HRV) measurements, ECG signals should be recorded with an optimal sampling frequency between 250 to 500 Hz. The recordings should last at least 5 minutes for preferred analysis, though shorter durations can be used for specific components (1 minute for high frequency and 2 minutes for low frequency components). \nHRV measurements typically analyze different frequency bands: high frequency (HF) oscillations between 0.15-0.4 Hz, and low frequency (LF) below 0.15 Hz. These measurements can include time domain measures like SDNN (standard deviation of normal RR intervals) and frequency domain measures like HF power, LF power, and the LF/HF ratio, which is considered an indirect index of sympatho-vagal balance. \nFor accurate measurements, it's important that ectopic beats, arrhythmic events, missing data, and noise effects should be properly filtered and omitted from the analysis. Frequency domain methods are preferred for short-term investigations.",

The data shows resting heart rates of around 59.7-63.2 bpm, and 24-hour heart rates ranging from 72.2-76.9 bpm in the study population. \nYour average heart rate of 77.4 bpm (range 75.3-78.9) appears to be slightly higher than the reference values shown in the search results, but it's important to note that this data comes from just one specific study and may not represent the full range of normal heart rates in the general population. Additionally, without more context about when and how your measurements were taken (resting vs. 24-hour), it's difficult to make a direct comparison.",

While C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are mentioned as inflammatory biomarkers that were studied in relation to cardiovascular disease and mortality, the search results don't explain what these specifically indicate about health beyond their association with inflammation. \nIn general terms, the search results indicate that biomarkers are characteristics that can be objectively measured to indicate normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to interventions. Good biomarkers should be measurable through minimal invasive procedures (typically through blood or urine), have a reasonable half-life, be stable, and not be affected by collection or storage conditions. Their clinical validation should include established reference values for healthy populations and defined cut-off values for diseased conditions.",
