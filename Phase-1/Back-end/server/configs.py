                        Example 1
            Data (Hourly):

            Lab Value: Cortisol
            Hour 0: Mean: 120 nmol/L, Std Dev: 15 nmol/L
            Hour 1: Mean: 130 nmol/L, Std Dev: 20 nmol/L
            Hour 2: Mean: 140 nmol/L, Std Dev: 18 nmol/L
            Hour 3: Mean: 150 nmol/L, Std Dev: 20 nmol/L
            Hour 6: Mean: 500 nmol/L, Std Dev: 45 nmol/L
            Hour 12: Mean: 300 nmol/L, Std Dev: 35 nmol/L
            Hour 18: Mean: 200 nmol/L, Std Dev: 25 nmol/L
            Hour 23: Mean: 150 nmol/L, Std Dev: 20 nmol/L
            Summary:
            Cortisol levels display a typical circadian rhythm, with gradual increases starting around midnight (Hour 0) and peaking at Hour 6 (Mean: 500 nmol/L, Std Dev: 45 nmol/L). Levels decline steadily throughout the day, reaching their lowest point late at night (Hour 23, Mean: 150 nmol/L).
                        Lab Value: Glucose
            Hour 0: Mean: 85 mg/dL, Std Dev: 4 mg/dL
            Hour 1: Mean: 86 mg/dL, Std Dev: 5 mg/dL
            Hour 7: Mean: 100 mg/dL, Std Dev: 8 mg/dL
            Hour 8: Mean: 120 mg/dL, Std Dev: 10 mg/dL
            Hour 13: Mean: 105 mg/dL, Std Dev: 9 mg/dL
            Hour 18: Mean: 95 mg/dL, Std Dev: 7 mg/dL
            Hour 23: Mean: 90 mg/dL, Std Dev: 6 mg/dL
            Summary:
            Glucose levels show a post-meal rise in the morning (Hour 8, Mean: 120 mg/dL, Std Dev: 10 mg/dL) and afternoon (Hour 13, Mean: 105 mg/dL, Std Dev: 9 mg/dL). Levels are more stable during nighttime hours 
            (Mean: ~85–90 mg/dL) with lower variability.

            Data (Across Days):

            Lab Value: Uric Acid
            Day 1: Mean: 0.40 mmol/L, Std Dev: 0.05 mmol/L
            Day 2: Mean: 0.38 mmol/L, Std Dev: 0.04 mmol/L
            Day 3: Mean: 0.35 mmol/L, Std Dev: 0.03 mmol/L
            Day 4: Mean: 0.32 mmol/L, Std Dev: 0.03 mmol/L
            Summary:
            Uric acid levels show a consistent decrease across the four days, with the mean dropping from 0.40 mmol/L on Day 1 to 0.32 mmol/L on Day 4. Standard deviations also decrease slightly, indicating reduced variability in uric acid levels as the days progress. This trend may reflect a gradual metabolic adjustment or external influences, such as dietary changes or improved hydration.
